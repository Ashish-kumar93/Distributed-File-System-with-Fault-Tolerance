# Distributed-File-System-with-Fault-Tolerance
This project is a Distributed File System (DFS) built using Python, designed to store and access files across multiple networked storage nodes with high reliability. The system splits files into chunks, distributes them across nodes, and ensures that data remains accessible even if one or more nodes fail.
